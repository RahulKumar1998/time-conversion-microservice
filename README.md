# time-conversion-microservice
A simple Spring boot project to make a Time-Conversion-Microservice 

* Created two microservices as part of this project : 

1. User Input Service - tomcat runs on 8085 port
2. Time Conversion Service - tomcat runs on 8081 port


* Created custom exception to check for Invalid Time Format

* Added unit tests for different scenarios while hitting the Time Conversion Service endpoint.

* Tested the API with POSTMAN:
